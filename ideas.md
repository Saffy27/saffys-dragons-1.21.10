Ideas for Mod:
- Make dragons have inverse kinematics for walking along the ground, such that their feet and bodies play nicely with inclines.
- Allow dragons to dominate a village, and use the villagers to increase their wealth/hoards and power.
- Create baby to ancient dragons with varying health, attack power, and skills
- Create various types of dragons (chromatic, metallic, etc.)
- Create spawning rules of lairs, so dragons only spawn rarely, and in certain biomes.
- Make the dragon solid like the happy ghast?
- Specify parts of the dragon's lair which are exits, to allow its brain system to go to those, then be able to fly freely.
- Let dragons (powerful ones) keep a memory in their brains of all villages and civilizations within a certain range, by storing the structure/poi position.
